     instantiated to provide the functionality of the enclosing element.

<!-- A "BeanName" is the identifier of a JavaBean, such as a form bean,
     and also serves as the name of the corresponding scripting variable
     and the name of the JSP attribute under which the bean is accessed.
     Therefore, it must conform to the rules for a Java identifier.
