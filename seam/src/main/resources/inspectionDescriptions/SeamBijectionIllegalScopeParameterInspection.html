<p>Reports the <code>scope</code> parameters in <code>@In</code> and <code>@Out</code> annotations
for cases when Seam always uses the scope defined by the component itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    When specifying <code>@In(create=true)</code>, the context variable must belong to a declared Seam component.
    Else, Seam would not know which class to instantiate.
    In other words, for <code>create=true</code> you cannot inject values that are not Seam components.
    Seam always uses the scope defined in the component declaration
    (the default scope for the component type or the scope defined in <code>@Scope</code> or <code>@Role</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    When you eject a value of a declared Seam component with <code>@Out</code>, the scope is always taken from that component.
    You can use <code>@Out(scope=...)</code> only when you are not ejecting a Seam component.
  </li>
