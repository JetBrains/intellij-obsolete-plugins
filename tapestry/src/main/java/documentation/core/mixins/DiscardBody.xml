        Discards a component's body. Returns false from the org.apache.tapestry.annotations.BeforeRenderBody phase, which prevents the rendering of the body. Set up as a "MixinAfter" so that
        components can render their an alternative body if they so desire before this mixin cancels the normal body (from the container's template).
