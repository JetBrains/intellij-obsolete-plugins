        Used to render out all informal parameters, at the end of the org.apache.tapestry.annotations.BeginRender phase. This mixin can be used with components that render a single tag inside the\
        org.apache.tapestry.annotations.BeginRender phase. RenderInformals will activate during the PostBeginRender phase to write additional attributes, from the informal parameters, into the active\
        element. If you want this behavior, but need to render more than a single tag, then implement render phase methods for the org.apache.tapestry.annotations.BeforeRenderTemplate and\
        org.apache.tapestry.annotations.AfterRenderTemplate phases. Use those phases to write the additional elements and close them. This is often used as a base class, for cases where a component\
        doesn't have other mixins.
