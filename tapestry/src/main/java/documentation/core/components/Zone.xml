        A Zone is portion of the output page designed for easy dynamic updating via Ajax or other client-side effects. A Zone renders out as a div element and may have content initially, or may\
        only get its content as a result of client side activity. Often, Zone's are initially invisible, in which case the visible parameter may be set to false (it defaults to false). When a user\
        clicks an org.apache.tapestry.corelib.components.ActionLink whose zone parameter is set, the corresponding client-side Tapestry.Zone object is located. It will update the content of the\
        Zone's div and then invoke either a show method (if the div is not visible) or an update method (if the div is visible). The show and update parameters are the names of functions attached to\
        the Tapestry.ZoneEffects object. Renders informal parameters, adding CSS class "t-zone" and possibly, "t-invisible".

    <parameters>
        <parameter name="show">
            Name of a function on the client-side Tapestry.ZoneEffects object that is invoked to make the Zone's div visible before being updated. If not specified, then the basic "show" method is\
            used.
        </parameter>
        <parameter name="update">
            Name of a function on the client-side Tapestry.ZoneEffects object that is invoked after the Zone's content has been updated. If not specified, then the basic "highlight" method is\
            used, which performs a classic "yellow fade" to indicate to the user that and update has taken place.
        </parameter>
        <parameter name="visible">
            If true (the default) then the zone will render normally. If false, then the "t-invisible" CSS class is added, which will make the zone initially invisible.
        </parameter>
