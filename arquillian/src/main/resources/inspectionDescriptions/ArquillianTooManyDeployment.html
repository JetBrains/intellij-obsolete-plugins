<p>Reports Arquillian test case classes that define multiple deployments.</p>
<p>
  According to the <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/arquillian/reference/1.0.0.Alpha5/en-US/html/gettingstarted.html#d0e451">Arquillian
  documentation</a>, Arquillian test classes should define the deployment archive using a public static method with a specific signature,
  annotated with <code>@Deployment</code> annotation. There should be a single deployment per test case, counting the
  methods defined in the test case super classes.
